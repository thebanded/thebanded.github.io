                Coming from a clan known as THU (The Havoc Union), mongoX89X (a former private in thr THU miltary) resigned in hope to form a clan called T.A.S.C, (The Assassination Spartan Clan). Despite its name, mongoX89X had no intention of creating a militized, or mercenary based clan, instead mongoX89X wanted to create a family oriented clan to substitute for his unfair treatment in The Havoc Union.

                Shortly after the formation of T.A.S.C, the leader of THU (who went by the name of Director Onyx at the time), issued a warning to all the current members in T.A.S.C due to the conspiracy of "double clanning". With these accusations, many lobbies were contested by T.A.S.C and THU and eventually mongoX89X and second in command vegas1911 sent DBD Afterlife to assassinate Director Onyx.

                After being cornered with no other options T.A.S.C agreed to the raid against THU and were aided by the CST in an effort to take WRC Nova Fortress. During the raid many T.A.S.C disgruntled members refused to partake in the offensive raid which left T.A.S.C offensive forces weak and easy to supress. Halfway through the Battle for WRC Nova Fortress CST ordered a retreat due to their disagreement in engaging militarily, resulting in one of the biggest raid losses in T.A.S.C history.

                Through an unknown method, Director Onyx and many other officers at THU were able to monitor T.A.S.C activity even under the concealment of CST, but rather than progress aggression, THU proposed an alliance in hope to help both clans grow. A meeting was held to discuss the estblishment of this policy, intially the tension between THU and T.A.S.C was still great and a shootout erupted within the meeting after an arguement between DBD Afterlife and mongoX89X, but after several failed attempts, a centralized alliance was reached.

Instead T.A.S.C emphasized politcal influence to generate security, and joined a coalition to prevent them T.A.S.C from being attacked by larger clans within the community. T.A.S.C also aimed to value diversity and welcomed players with unique backgrounds, one notable player included CanadianGirlEh5 who undergoed training to becoming a future T.A.S.C Captain.

The military captain at the time (Longshot), vegas1911 and mongoX89X initiated several offensive campaigns against clans throughout the community to test military capabilities which led to the destruction of many clans including The Solace Republic and Jolly's Rebels (who had rebelled against THU).

After an arguement broke out the leader of C.R.C (CRC NorthDakota), shot the leader of T.E.S (SGT Caboose), the other clans then proceeded to exchange gunshots until C.R.C juggernauts wiped the meeting room. The meeting shifted into an offesive raid against with T.A.S.C and U.G.A attacking T.B.3 and C.R.C. After 2 hours the raid was deemed victorious in T.A.S.C and U.G.A's favor and the news quickly spread throughout the community. The war between the two coalitions ended when an unknown clan defeated T.B.3, which frightened C.R.C into submission.

                Although T.A.S.C and THU had established an alliance, several disagreements between the two clans still insued, one notable disagreement was due to internal clan functions and how the clan should be run. After weeks of arguement T.A.S.C refused to make any more maps for THU which resulted in hostility, shortly after a map tarif was placed on THU, Director Onyx assassinated mongoX89X in a forge lobby resulting in a defensive raid against THU in the TASC 2.0 fortress. After THU forces had been supressed for 40 minutes, THU members left the game lobby leaving Director Onyx the only offensive participant for THU. After THU was unable to take the fortress Director Onyx disbanded THU as a result of the raid loss and took a few trusted members with him to form a mercenary group called The Blood Brothers, while the rest formed a clan called T.D.L (acronym unknown).

After the tournament it was decided that CanadianGirlEh5 would become the elected captain in T.A.S.C. This decision generated a sense of unrest within T.A.S.C as many disagreed with the fact that she should have been captain; members left, arguements broke out, and meetings were canceled due to the possibility of CanadianGirlEh5 being assassinated and paranoia.

THU decided to defend WRC Nova Fortress aided by T.D.L and two other unkown clans while T.A.S.C attacked alongside the allied U.G.A World Eaters led by Mac Oda Lucifer and CST. Within less than an hour, T.A.S.C and U.G.A were able to overthrow WRC Nova Fortress and put The Blood Brothers and T.D.L on the offensive. Despite this The Blood Brothers and T.D.L continued to attack the fortress to regain control. T.A.S.C requested U.G.A to leave the lobby stating that the battle was personal. Even with U.G.A gone, T.A.S.C was able to secure the fortress for five hours, and were ordered to leave the lobby after attacking The Blood Brothers and T.D.L at spawn until they had each died once after the order. As a result, seven clans were involved during the raid and fifty players in total particpated.

During this time, internal clan relationships were still questionable due to paranoia from the captain tournament. One notable T.A.S.C member (Tracey) who was later found to be working with T.D.L and CanadianGirlEh5 sparked several arguements within T.A.S.C to create choas. This lead mongoX89X to cut all clan communications during his absence. During this time, mongoX89X was unaware CanadianGirlEh5, gamer09master, and vegas1911's plan to take over T.A.S.C. The three captains changed the colors, structure and even the emblem. After mongoX89X returned from his absence he was furious to find that T.A.S.C had been taken from him and asked for his position back as leader. All three captains refused to give T.A.S.C which lead mongoX89X to become enraged and threaten the newly restructered T.A.S.C. As a result, CanadianGirlEh5 turned U.G.A, T.E.S, and C.R.C against mongoX89X and continued to restructure T.A.S.C. This lead mongoX89X to submit to opposing forces, but not before taking several T.A.S.C members with him.

The Banded Reprisals undergoed a strategy similar to that during the Remnants Era which included staying under the radar until T.B.R was able to make it's presence known.

                After a month of rebuilding, T.B.R launced a campaign against T.A.S.C and U.G.A, aided by the Imperium of Man. T.B.R intended attack U.G.A first before attacking T.A.S.C, then launch a suprise attack on T.A.S.C when they suspect T.B.R is occupied with U.G.A. T.B.R and the Imperium of Man stormed U.G.A in a siege that lasted an hour against the U.G.A Main Military and the U.G.A World Eaters. The siege ended in a victory as the U.G.A ended the game while the fortress was contested. Shortly after the seige T.B.R launched an invasion on the U.G.A Iron Hands, disrupting their military training and slowing down recruitment by attacking a bootcamp lobby.

              <p>
                After a chain of successful attacks against U.G.A, T.B.R sent several search parties out to T.A.S.C to seek answers for their betrayal and take them down. T.B.R was suprised when their search parties had discovered that T.A.S.C had infact disbanded while T.B.R was attacking U.G.A out of inactivity and fear that they would be attacked by T.B.R. Despite this, it did not stop T.B.R from finding the rogue captains from T.A.S.C and assassinating each one. Only sparing vegas1911 who had left the game entirely.
